1.Added TypeOfElement NewElement to Circuit class so we know what eleement we need to create.

2.Changed the AddElement method adding a TypeOfElement 
parameter in Circuit so we know what eleement we need to create.

3,Finished the AddConnection method in Circuit

4.Did MoveElement method in circuit

5.Did RemoveElement

6.Did RemoveConnection 
(Its the bloody same method as remove element. maybe we can lose one later)

7.We need to modify the accesability of variables, 
so i can assign an id, or change the constructors. We need to debate this

8.Added IDcounter in Form1.

DAY 2

9. Currently engaged in Record class. I think we need the parameter of the currentlist
or to return the new list. Still thinking. 

10. Ok so i figured it out. 

Everytime i ADD an element in the FORM i update the list in the RECORD class
Why? So if i delete the element, i can have it back.(why i return the old list)
SO if the type of change is Remove i can get back the element.

Everytime i move an element i use the method for its old x and y.

ANd if i add an element i can just remove it from the list.

Keep in mind that i need the parameter currentlist to get the new list.

EASYREDO is just the safety net in case i make something wrong. It reverses the undo.

11. Finished RECORD class. :D

12. Added the buttons to the form.

13. Added UNDO REDO UPDATEUNDOREDOs methods to circuit to communicate between the FORM and CIRCUIT
